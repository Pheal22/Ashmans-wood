        <h2>Welcome to Ashmans Wood</h2>
        <p>Ashmans Wood is a new woodland that we have planted under the England Woodland Creation Offer (EWCO) which is being overseen by the Forestry Commission. </p>                        
        <p>The new woodland covers a field of 2.1 hectares which is a mixture of British native trees such as Oak, Holly, Hornbeam etc. In all there are 19 different species which we hope will provide interest all year round.</p>
         <p>Note: We know that the Horse Chestnut and Sycamore are not strictly 'Native' but they have naturalised throughout the UK to such an extent that we consider them as such now!</p>

    <section id="about">
        <h2>The Trees</h2>
        <p>Each tree is planted 2.5m apart and every sapling is supported by a green tree guard. This tube will protect the sapling from predators such as rabbits, pigeons and deer for the first 3-5 years of growth. The tubes will also provide a sheltered environment (similar to a small greenhouse) which helps to speed the trees growth upwards, after which the tree will start to spread outwards, once beyond the top of the tube. </p>
        <p>Planting has been planned so that the tallest trees remain in the middle if the woodland with the smaller trees surrounding the outer edges to give a graduated top line to the woodland.</p>
        <p>We have also tried to match, as best as possible, the conditions in the field to the preference of each type of tree.  For instance, the White Willows are mainly grouped in a corner of the field where the wettest conditions occur.</p>
        <p>Finally, we hope to have designed the layout so that there is interest across the seasons, blossom during the spring, texture in the summer and leaf colour during the autumn.</p>

    <section id="care">
        <h2>Care and Recycling</h2>
        <p>At the base of each sapling is a plastic 1metre square mulch mat. This mat will help to keep weeds and grass at bay, as well as helping to conserve moisture by preventing evaporation during dryer times. The trees will not be manually watered, so will need a good source of moisture below ground at all times. </p>
        <p>Both the tree guards and mulch mats will be collected and recycled at the end of their life. The plastic pegs holding the mulch mats in place will biodegrade after 5-7 years so will not need to be removed.  </p>
        <p>During the first five years of the woodland, we will replace any of the trees that have failed, thereafter the woodland will be allowed to grow as the conditions allow.  Here's hoping for 5 years free from any more extreme weather!</p>

    <section id="farm">
        <h2>Tobitt's Farm</h2>
        <p>The area running along the roadside hedge between the footpath and the field gate is unplanted. This is because it is the site of a former medieval/early post medieval farmstead called Tobittâ€™s Farm. This is a designated site of historical interest and at the request of Maldon District Council, was left undisturbed in case future investigation may be requested.     </p>
