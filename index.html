        <h2>Welcome to Ashmans Wood</h2>
        <p>Ashmans Wood is a new woodland that we have planted under the England Woodland Creation Offer (EWCO) which is being overseen by the Forestry Commission. </p>                        
        <p>The new woodland covers a field of 2.1 hectares which is a mixture of British native trees such as Oak, Holly, Hornbeam etc. In all there are 19 different species which we hope will provide interest all year round.</p>

        <h2>The Trees</h2>
        <p>Each tree is planted 2.5m apart and every sapling is supported by a green tree guard. This tube will protect the sapling from predators such as rabbits, pigeons and deer for the first 3-5 years of growth. The tubes will also provide a sheltered environment (similar to a small greenhouse) which helps to speed the trees growth upwards, after which the tree will start to spread outwards, once beyond the top of the tube. </p>

    <section id=care">
        <h2>Care and Recycling</h2>
        <p>At the base of each sapling is a plastic 1metre square mulch mat. This mat will help to keep weeds and grass at bay, as well as helping to conserve moisture by preventing evaporation during dryer times. The trees will not be manually watered, so will need a good source of moisture below ground at all times. </p>
        <p>Both the tree guards and mulch mats will be collected and recycled at the end of their life. The plastic pegs holding the mulch mats in place will biodegrade after 5-7 years so will not need to be removed.  </p>

    <section id="farm">
        <h2>Tobitt's Farm</h2>
        <p>The area running along the roadside hedge between the footpath and the field gate is unplanted. This is because it is the site of a former medieval/early post medieval farmstead called Tobittâ€™s Farm. This is a designated site of historical interest and at the request of Maldon District Council, was left undisturbed in case future investigation may be requested.     </p>
